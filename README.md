# Sketch_It_Turtle
Drawing chemical formulas using Python based on Turtle logic

The best way to use this code is to draw the molecule first and then select the backbone and branches accordingly.
And dont forget to mark the locations for ease.
Hopefully in the future I'll add more features (like free electrons and ionic charges, resonance structures, wavey bonds to symbolize long chains, etc.)...
...and make the code more user friendly
