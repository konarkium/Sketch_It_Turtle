wavey bonds were added
all kinds of bonds (wavey, double, above n below the plane) were converted into a single function
a backstep feature was added that can be read by the turtle function
(the reson why the py files are numbered as 4 is because the 2nd and 3rd files were dedicated to make wavey bonds and other stuff)
